In this tutorial we will see how to run your web application, stored on your laptop/desktop computer on your mobile device.



1) Download XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

2) Install XAMPP

3) Put the folder that contains your solution in the htdocs directory of XAMPP (it is usually stored in the following path: C:\xampp\htdocs)

On Windows computers you can do it by going:
